Tools for web+game developers.

Game Engines
---

[Phaser](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser-ce) : Free

**My go-to game engine for creating 2D browser games** - the games you create will be performant on desktop and mobile, and fast to develop too. Everything is written in Javascript, so it’s pretty easy to get into. I’m looking forward to Phaser 3 later this year.

[PlayCanvas](https://github.com/playcanvas/engine) : Free (subscriptions available)

Another browser game engine, which I can recommend if you need 3D. Paid options are available, but I’d recommend sticking to the GitHub version to start with. Also consider THREE.js and A-FrameVR if you need 3D without the game logic (A-Frame has a built-in animation framework).

[GameMaker Studio 2](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) : Paid, variety of licenses available

GameMaker is a full suite for creating 2D games across all major platforms (including browser). Some of my favourite games have been using Game Maker including Hotline Miami and Downwell. Game Maker 2 was released not too long ago.

[Unity](https://unity3d.com/) : Free (subscriptions available)

The full package. 2D/3D games which deploy to all platforms. Tons of tutorials are available, and it features a marketplace to purchase project solutions. I feel like **familiarising yourself with Unity is essential**. The down side is that it won’t build anything that will work in mobile browsers, which rules me out from using it for most projects.

[Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com) : Free (5% cut)

Unreal Engine is a lot like Unity, but I think it tailors itself more to teams, and much more 'advanced' developers. Unreal Engine will deliver high graphic capability and high performance, but you may find Unity is a smoother ride. Costs may be more user friendly for some developers.

Text Editors
---

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) : Free

A lightweight Visual Studio, this editor is maintained by Microsoft (and updated regularly), and has a lot of features out of the box. Plays nicely with Unity on all operating systems.

[Atom](http://atom.io) : Free

A cleaner, smaller solution for writing your code if you’d rather pick and choose your features; “the hackable text editor”. Created by GitHub.

App Publishing
---

[Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) : Free

Cordova is a straight forward way to wrap up your web projects into iOS and Android applications. It’s open source so it’s free to use, although I find quite a few of the plugins are not updated as often as I would like. Works with Phaser and PlayCanvas games. You may have heard of PhoneGap, which is essentially the same thing.

[Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) : Free

Use Electron when you need to create desktop applications. It’s made by GitHub, and is used by a variety of teams including Atom and Slack.

Asset Creation
---

[Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html) : Licensed

Photoshop is king of image manipulation. You do have to pay around £10 a month for Photoshop, but I promise you, you will need Photoshop and the skills to use it. Tutorials are available everywhere for beginners. Gimp is a free alternative but I've never thought highly of it.

[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) : Free

Wonderful photography that you can use for any purpose. If nothing else, it's great for inspiration.

[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) : Free

Blender is a free alternative to Maya. They both allow you to create and open 3D models, setup animations, and modify textures/UVS. I personally prefer Maya, but the entry costs are too high for me.

[Asset Forge](http://assetforge.io/) : Paid

A brand new 3D model creator from Kenney.nl (who has already made tons of great free game assets!). You create models by combining blocks, like you would Lego. It's still in Beta, but it's already nice enough to use.

[Incompetech](http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html) : Free

Great free music, which can often be hard to come by.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) : Free

You want to use good fonts, Google Fonts has tons of them. You can download a lot of them from their github https://github.com/google/fonts. https://www.typewolf.com/ can help you decide which ones are right for you.

[Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/) : Free (subscriptions available)

Free icons. Personally, I would rather see the same icons everywhere, than a poor attempt at making your own. Font Awesome 5 coming soon!

Pipeline
---

[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) : Free

Allows you to write your Javascript using the latest ES6 standards, and convert it to something that should work on IE.

[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) : Free

Node-based build tool, for automating your workflow (such as minifying files). Tons of plugins available.

[CodeKit](https://codekitapp.com/) : Paid

A nice to have (Mac only) build tool, which also sets up a basic http server with auto-refresh. Stick with Gulp on windows.

Data Storage
---

[GitHub](https://github.com) : Free (subscriptions available)

You should absolutely be using source control. GitHub is the most popular source control platform. You have to pay for private repositories, but it’s a service that’s never let me down. Try BitBucket as an alternative.

[GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) : Licensed

Personally I like using a GUI to manage my code commits. I like GitKraken a lot, but SourceTree is a free alternative.

[Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/) : Paid

Transmit let's you upload files to your server over FTP (Mac only). Filezilla is a free alternative.

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/home) : Free (subscriptions available)

For all your non-project files, you can upload them using Dropbox. One of the best features is that you can share files and folders with others. Google Photos is my preferred way of storing photography however.

Management
---

[Bear](http://www.bear-writer.com/) : Free (subscriptions available)

A beautiful tool for writing beautiful documents (markdown syntax). A small fee to have everything sync across your Apple devices (including tablets and phones). Only available for Apple devices , so if that’s an issue, try EverNote or Slack.

[Slack](https://slack.com/) : Free (subscriptions available)

Slack is a trendy way of talking among colleagues and sharing files to each other. Even if you work solo, I find it to still be a nice tool for managing notes and links across your defined channels. Has built in gif support too.

[Medium](https://medium.com) : Free (pay for custom domain)

If you don’t have time to manage your own hosted blog, style it up, and work out how you want to handle sharing and comments, then I think Medium is for you. With Medium, creating blog posts is a pleasant experience!

[LastPass](https://lastpass.com) : Free (subscriptions available)

LastPass allows you to use secure passwords everywhere you go on the web without having to worry about remembering any of them.
