Tools for web+game developers.

Game Engines
---

[Phaser](https://phaser.io/phaser3) : Free

**My go-to game engine for creating 2D browser games** - the games you create will be performant on desktop and mobile, and fast to develop too. Everything is written in Javascript, so it’s pretty easy to get into. I’m looking forward to Phaser 3 later this year.

[Unity](https://unity3d.com/) : Free (subscriptions available)

The full package. 2D/3D games which deploy to all platforms. Tons of tutorials are available, and it features a marketplace to purchase project solutions. I feel like **familiarising yourself with Unity is essential**. The down side is that it won’t build anything that will work in mobile browsers just yet, although some improvements to this were announced at the 2018 GDC conference.

[Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com) : Free (12% cut)

Unreal Engine is a lot like Unity, but I think it tailors itself better to larger teams, more ambitious projects, and generally more hands-on developers who love to dig a little deeper. Unreal Engine will deliver high graphic capability and high performance, but you may find Unity is a smoother ride. Costs may be more user friendly for some developers, especially with the recent change to 12% due to Fortnite's immense success.

[GameMaker Studio 2](https://www.yoyogames.com/gamemaker) : Paid, variety of licenses available

GameMaker is a full suite for creating 2D games across all major platforms (including browser). Some of my favourite games have been using Game Maker including Hotline Miami and Downwell. Game Maker 2 was released not too long ago.

Libraries
---

[A-Frame](https://aframe.io/) : Free

Create VR experiences for the browser (including mobile devices) using their easy-to-learn custom HTML syntax, and then hook up special functionality and events with your own Javascript using their pretty good documentation.

Text Editors
---

[Sublime Text 3](https://www.sublimetext.com/3) : Free(ish)

Sublime Text has been my go-to light-weight code editor for over 5 years. I would recommend switching to Visual Studio Code for bigger, longer-term projects, but Sublime is best for day-to-day tasks. It is truly sublime. Please pay for a license when you are ready to do so!

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) : Free

A lightweight Visual Studio, this editor is maintained by Microsoft (and updated regularly), and has a lot of features out of the box. Plays nicely with Unity on all operating systems.

App Publishing
---

[Cordova](https://cordova.apache.org/) : Free

Cordova is a straight forward way to wrap up your web projects into iOS and Android applications. It’s open source so it’s free to use, although I find quite a few of the plugins are not updated as often as I would like. Works with Phaser and PlayCanvas games. You may have heard of PhoneGap, which is essentially the same thing.

[Electron](https://electron.atom.io/) : Free

Use Electron when you need to create desktop applications. It’s made by GitHub, and is used by a variety of teams including Atom and Slack.

Asset Creation
---

[Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/uk/products/photoshop.html) : Licensed

Photoshop is king of image manipulation. You do have to pay around £10 a month for Photoshop, but I promise you, you will need Photoshop and the skills to use it. Tutorials are available everywhere for beginners. Gimp is a free alternative but I've never thought highly of it.

[Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/) : Free

Wonderful photography that you can use for any purpose. If nothing else, it's great for inspiration.

[Blender](https://www.blender.org/) : Free

Blender is a free alternative to Maya. They both allow you to create and open 3D models, setup animations, and modify textures/UVS. I personally prefer Maya, but the entry costs are too high for me.

[Incompetech](http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html) : Free

Great free music, which can often be hard to come by.

[Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/) : Free

You want to make sure you are using a good font, and Google Fonts has tons of them. You can download a lot of them from their github https://github.com/google/fonts. Use https://www.typewolf.com/ to help you decide which ones might be right for you.

[Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.com/) : Free (subscriptions available)

With the release of Font Awesome 5, there are many more icons in many more styles for you to use in any kind of project. 

Pipeline
---

[CodeKit](https://codekitapp.com/) : Paid

A nice to have (Mac only) build tool, which also sets up a basic http server with auto-refresh. Stick with Gulp on windows.

[Babel](https://babeljs.io/) : Free

Allows you to write your Javascript using the latest ES6 standards, and convert it to something that should work on IE.

[Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) : Free

Node-based build tool, for automating your workflow (such as minifying files). Tons of plugins available.

Data Storage
---

[GitHub](https://github.com) : Free (subscriptions available)

You should absolutely be using source control. GitHub is the most popular source control platform. You have to pay for private repositories, but it’s a service that’s never let me down. Try GitLab or BitBucket as an alternative.

[GitKraken](https://www.gitkraken.com/) : Licensed

Personally I like using a GUI to manage my code commits. I like GitKraken a lot, but SourceTree is a free alternative.

[Transmit](https://panic.com/transmit/) : Paid

Transmit let's you upload files to your server over FTP (Mac only), and now on version 5 is better than ever. Filezilla is a free alternative, although I find it hard to go back.

[Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/home) : Free (subscriptions available)

For all your non-project files, you can upload them using Dropbox. One of the best features is that you can share files and folders with others. Google Photos is my preferred way of storing photography however.

[WeTransfer](https://wetransfer.com/) : Free (subscriptions available)

At some point in time you will need to send a large file or bundle to someone. Don't clog up yours or their mailbox - use WeTransfer to send your files in style.

Management
---

[Bear](http://www.bear-writer.com/) : Free (subscriptions available)

A beautiful tool for writing beautiful documents (markdown syntax). A small fee to have everything sync across your Apple devices (including tablets and phones). Only available for Apple devices , so if that’s an issue, try EverNote or Slack.

[Slack](https://slack.com/) : Free (subscriptions available)

Slack is a trendy way of talking among colleagues and sharing files to each other. Even if you work solo, I find it to still be a nice tool for managing notes and links across your defined channels. Has built in gif support too.

[Medium](https://medium.com) : Free (pay for custom domain)

If you don’t have time to manage your own hosted blog, style it up, and work out how you want to handle sharing and comments, then I think Medium is for you. With Medium, creating blog posts is a pleasant experience!

[LastPass](https://lastpass.com) : Free (subscriptions available)

LastPass allows you to use secure passwords everywhere you go on the web without having to worry about remembering any of them.
